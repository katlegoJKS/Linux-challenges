BEGGINER LINUX CHALLENGES

Task 1: Basic Task

1. ~$ ls                                      #Enlists all files that exist within the current directory
2. ~$ pwd                                     #Displays the current working directory the user is currently in
3. ~$ mkdir workspace                         #Creates a folder named workspace
   ~$ cd ~/workspace
4. ~/workspace$ ls                            #Displays all files and folders that exist in the directory 'workspace'
5. ~/workspace$ touch README.md               #Creates a new file called README.md using the touch command
6. ~/wprkspace$ cp README.md                  #Makes a copy of the file README.md
   ~/workspace$ mv README.md CHANGELOG.md     #Renames the copy of README.md to CHANGELOG.md




Task 2:Absolute and Relative Paths

~$ mkdir tmp                     #Creates a folder tmp
~$ touch exercise.md             #Creates a file named exercise
~$ mv exercise.md ~/tmp          #Moves the file exercise to the tmp dirctory
~$ cd ~/tmp                      #Go into tmp directory
~/tmp$ rm exercise.md            #Deletes the file exercise.md





Task 3: cat commands

1. ~$ touch umuzi.md                                           #creates the file umuzi.md
   ~$ touch recruits.md                                        #creates the file recruits.md
   ~$ touch cohort.md                                          #craetes the file cohort.md
2. ~$ cat > umuzi.md                                           #Fills a file(s) with text content
   Umuzi is awesome
   ~$ cat recruits.md
   Umuzi recruits are cool
   ~$ cat cohort.md
   Umuzi cohorts are cool and awesome
3. ~$ cat umuzi.md recruits.md cohort.md                       #Combines all contents of the 3 files and displays the result
4. ~$ cat umuzi.md recruits.md cohort.md -> summary.md         #Print/Stores the previous output into summary.md and appends the words "The End."
   The End.




Task 4 : The locate command

1. ~$ locate umuzi                        #locates the file umuzi.md
2. ~$ locate umuzi > search_results.md    #searches and loctes the file umuzi.md and laods this search result into a file named search_result.md
   ~$ cat search_results.md               #outputs contents of search_results





Task 5: The locate command cont..

1. ~$ cd ~/Documents                      #Goto documents folder
   ~/Documents$ touch pad.md              #creates a new file pad.md
   ~/Documents$ cd
   ~$                                     #Go back to home directory
2. ~$ cd ~/Desktop                        #Goto Desktop 
   ~/Desktop$ mkdir work                  #Creates a new folder called work
3. ~/Desktop$ cd ~/Documents              #changes working directory to documents
   ~/Documents$ cp pad.md pad_copy.md     #copies the file pad.md and renames the copy as pad_copy.md
4. ~/Documents$ locate updatedb           #serches the folder updatedb
5. ~/Documents$ cd -                      #goes to previous working directory
   ~$
6. locate pad_copy.md                     #locates the path of pad_copy




Task 6: Find commands

1. ~$ find ~/ -name *.pdf                    #Command that searches the system and finds vall files that are in .pdf format and displays results
2. ~$ find ~/ -name *.pdf > searchresults    #takes the result of the previous search and copies into the folder searchresults
   ~$ ls
3. ~$ find . type f -newermt 2020-01-16 -ls  #displays files that have been modified today




Task 7: Text

1. ~$ nano my_bio.md                         #creates a file my_bio.md and awaits input/content
2. #Press Ctrl+o to exit nano
3. ~$ mkdir my_files                         #creates a new folder called my_files
   ~$ mv my_bio.md ~/my_files                #moves the file my_bio.md into the folder my_files
